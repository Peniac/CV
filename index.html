      <h2>Professional Experience and Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My experience and interests are centered on the development and application of machine-learning and optimization algorithms (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, linear programming, heuristics) on networked compute systems. Indicatively, I have successfully implemented optimization modules for the management of intra-node resources, such as the CPU frequency and the last-level cache, as well as cluster-wide resources.

      <h2>Research background</h2>
      <p>
        My research revolves around optimizations in modern networks. While new technologies, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV), emerge to address concrete limitations of prevailing network deployments, they introduce some complexities as well, with resource allocation challenges being the most prominent. My research sets out to investigate and tackle a critical subset of these challenges.
